### **Feature Overview**

Customers migrating to OpenShift Virtualization from traditional virtualization platforms often rely on third-party
systems for network management, including established workflows for provisioning and allocating IP addresses to
virtual machines.

The feature allows a third party IPAM solution to specify on a VM the IP address it should use.
Specifically focused on the primary pod network in a (L2) UDN network type.

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

#### **1. Scope of Testing**

Tests are aimed to cover the ability to define at VM definition its primary pod network IP address.
The functionality is limited to UDN.

**Testing Goals**

- **[P0]** Verify IP address definition through cloud-init is reaching the guest OS.
- **[P0]** Confirm east-west connectivity in the cluster.
- **[P0]** Confirm north-south connectivity from/to the cluster.
- **[P1]** Verify IP persists over power cycle.
- **[P1]** Verify seamless connectivity is preserved over migration.
- **[P2]** Verify IP address definition through the default DHCP is reaching the guest OS.

**Out of Scope (Testing Scope Exclusions)**

|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Non UDN primary pod network      | The feature is currently limited to UDN only network types.                                                                                                         | [x] ronen@redhat.com (12/2025)    |
| Secondary networks (of any kind) | The feature is currently limited to the primary UDN network.                                                                                                        | [x] ronen@redhat.com (12/2025)    |
| IPv6 support                     | IPv6 support is not yet planned for the primary pod network (of any type). Current limitation on UDN networks is mainly due to test coverage.                       | [x] ronen@redhat.com (01/2026)    |
| UI support                       | The feature is intended for 3rd party integration tools and has no formal user oriented exposure.                                                                   | [x] ronen@redhat.com (12/2025)    |
| Observability                    | There are no requirements or needs to have this feature covered by metrics or telemetry at this stage.                                                              | [x] ronen@redhat.com (01/2026)    |
| Core OCP network functionality   | The functionality is based on OCP network OVN-K & ipam-extensions pod level solutions, the OCP-V layered product assumes the core functionality is already covered. | [x] phoracek@redhat.com (12/2025) |

| Cloud Testing                  | Does the feature require multi-cloud platform testing? Consider cloud-specific features.                                                                     | Y                       | The feature should be agnostic to the platform used, therefore, running the same tests on the cloud should be applicable.                                     |

#### **6. Known Limitations**

- Single-stack IPv6 is not planned for coverage at the initial GA.
- Except for specific core features, like power-cycle and live-migration, cross regression functionality is not planned.
- Coverage on special architectures (e.g. ARM64) is not planned, although the feature is considered agnostic.
- Primary UDN coverage assumes classic Guest OS (Fedora-based), with cloud-init and/or dynamic (DHCP) IPv4 support.
- Special guest OS, e.g. Windows, is expected to work with cloud-init and/or dynamic (DHCP) IPv4. However, no explicit tests are planned to cover them.
