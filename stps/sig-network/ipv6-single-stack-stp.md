### **Feature Overview**
OpenShift Virtualization functionality on IPv6 single-stack clusters.
During feature verification, we ensure that core networking, storage,
and virtualization workflows function correctly without relying on IPv4.
The testing effort focuses on adapting existing test coverage to run in IPv6-only
environments, including network configuration, service exposure, and VM connectivity.
This work is critical for customers deploying OpenShift Virtualization in IPv6-mandated
infrastructures and ensures readiness for GA without impacting cluster topology or architecture.

### **II. Software Test Plan (STP)**

#### **1. Scope of Testing**
Ensure existing covered functionality for OpenShift Virtualization is preserved when it is deployed on an
IPv6 single-stack cluster. The focus is on the main functionalities of the product, covering network, virt
and storage domains.

**Testing Goals:**
Ensuring all existing functionality works correctly with IPv6-only configurations:
- [P0] sig-network T1
- [P0] sig-virt T1
- [P0] sig-storage T1
- [P0] sig-network T2 Gating
- [P0] sig-virt T2 Gating
- [P0] sig-storage T2 Gating
- [P0] sig-network T2 Regression
- [P1] UI
- [P1] Monitoring
- [P1] sig-virt T2 Regression
- [P1] sig-storage T2 Regression

**Note:** IOU and Infra sigs do not require dedicated IPv6 lanes; IPv6 network testing coverage is sufficient.

| Test Environment     | N/A                                                                                                                 | No significant environment-related risks identified                                  | [x]           |

| Dependencies         | Collaboration with other teams required to troubleshoot failures in their test suites on IPv6 single-stack clusters | Coordinate with respective teams for debugging and provide IPv6 support              | [x]           |


#### **6. Known Limitations**

- KMP tests will not be adjusted for IPv6 single-stack; IPv4 test coverage is sufficient.
- Flat overlay network will not be tested as IPv6 support is not yet available.
- The following components will be adjusted in subsequent releases and are currently excluded from testing with special markers: MTV, BGP, jumbo frames, Service mesh, CCLM


### **III. Test Scenarios & Traceability**

Since this feature spans multiple features and SIGs, all existing tests are relevant and will be adjusted accordingly.

| Requirement ID   | Requirement Summary                                                         | Test Scenario(s)       | Tier   | Priority |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-------|:---------|
| CNV-28924 (epic) | All existing components, with exceptions (see section 6. Known Limitations) | All existing scenarios | Tier 2 | P0       |
